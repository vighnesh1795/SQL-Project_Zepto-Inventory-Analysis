Zepto Inventory Data Analysis and Cleaning:

This project involves creating and analyzing an inventory database for Zepto products using SQL. The focus is on data exploration, data cleaning, and performing insightful queries to support inventory management and pricing strategies.

Project Description:

The Zepto inventory database simulates product stock and pricing information. It includes attributes like SKU, category, product name, MRP, discount percentage, available quantity, selling price, weight in grams, stock status, and order quantity.

The project covers:

1. Database table creation with defined schema and constraints.

2. Data exploration for understanding distribution, duplicates, and null values.

3. Data cleaning tasks such as removing entries with zero pricing and converting pricing units.

4. Analytical queries to extract business insights, including:

--Top discounted products.

--Out of stock products with high MRP.

--Estimated revenue per category.

--High-priced products with low discounts.

--Categories offering the highest average discounts.

--Price per gram comparisons for heavier products.

--Categorization of products by weight (Low, Medium, Bulk).

--Total inventory weight for each category.

These analyses enable data-driven decisions for inventory control, pricing optimizations, and stock replenishment.

Technologies Used:
1. PostgreSQL / Any SQL-compatible database system
2. Standard SQL commands for data manipulation and querying# SQL-Project_Zepto-Inventory-Analysis
